# SQL-CoolTShirts-Touch-Attribution-Query

# Project Description:

## Introduction

CoolTShirts (CTS) is a trendy online retailer that specializes in selling a wide variety of shirts, with one primary requirement â€“ they must be T-shaped and, of course, cool. To boost their online presence and increase sales, CTS has initiated several marketing campaigns in recent times. These campaigns are designed to attract visitors to the website and encourage them to make purchases. To better understand the effectiveness of these marketing initiatives, CTS is keen on implementing touch attribution analysis. By mapping the customer journey from the initial website visit to the final purchase, they aim to optimize their marketing strategies and allocate resources more efficiently.

## Data Overview
### page_visits Table: 
page_name, timestamp, user_id, utm_campaign, utm_source

## Project Objectives


-   **Data Collection:** Data from CTS's website and marketing channels will be collected, including details on website visits, marketing campaign interactions, and conversion events.
    
-   **Data Preparation:** The collected data will be cleaned and organized, ensuring that it is in a format suitable for analysis.
    
-   **Touch Attribution Models:** Various attribution models, such as First Touch, Last Touch, Linear, Time Decay, and U-Shaped, will be applied to the data to understand the influence of different touchpoints.
    
-   **Customer Journey Mapping:** The customer journey will be examined, revealing the paths that customers take before making a purchase.
    
-   **Optimization Strategies:** Recommendations will be formulated based on the insights from the analysis. These may include adjusting marketing budgets, improving targeting, or experimenting with new channels.

-- Given the data in this project, if CoolTShirts were to re-invest in five campaigns, they should pick weekly-newsletter, retargetting-ad on Facebook, retargetting-campaign email, paid-search, and either ten-crazy-cool-tshirts-facts or getting-to-know-cool-tshirts article as these campaigns resulted in the most purchases.
